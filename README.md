# Whampire

This repo is an example Mesos Framework built at the MesosCon 2015 Mesos Hackathon.

The framework comes with a scheduler and executor that work together to scrape web urls.

Our goals were to:

 - Learn the basics of Mesos Framework internals
 - Utilize an API in the scheduler
 - Integrate a database for persistant storage
